# Database schema
For reference only, the following queries should allow migration of a new postgres database.

Assumes extensions installed, roles set up, etc.

The `queries/` directory is little more a dumping ground for queries that could be useful. Kept around for reference only, and not actually used anywhere.

For queries in use, see API endpoints in `/pages/api`, as well as https://github.com/kwoodhouse93/trail-progress-worker.
