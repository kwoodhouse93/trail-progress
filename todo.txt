TODO:

HIGH (essential)
- Fix timeouts in backfill
    - Consider using a single COPY instead of hundreds of INSERT statements
- If backfill succeeds but those activities aren't inserted, we need to be able to catch that error - store activity count alongside updating backfill_status?

MEDIUM (needed before launch)
- Implement removal of user data (on Strava webhook, plus a 'Delete account' button in /account?)
- Implement Strava webhooks for receiving new events
- Add more trails
- Find a way to show background processing in progress / completion
- Setting map zoom level seems to work locally but not when deployed... Weird
- API Authentication / RLS

LOW (nice to have)
- Add headline stats for each trail on /trails page
- Consider a mapping library with support for static maps (e.g. for activity summary maps - loading lots of interactive maps but disabling interaction doesn't seem sensible)
- Check and respect rate limits to avoid overuse
- Add activity count to /account
- Check user is redirected to / if not authed on all pages (e.g. /pending)
- Add favicon and Strava app icon
- Review screens that flash content - consider global loading state?
- Add user settings for units and activity types to include

VERY LOW (do at some point)
- Look into pulling streams and processing these in addition to polylines - is it really necessary? What's the max. privacy area on Strava?
- Check we meet Strava brand guidelines
- Dark mode
- Consider alternative map tiles / mapping library
