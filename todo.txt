TODO:

NOW

MEDIUM (needed before launch)
- Test token refresh
- Add more trails

LOW (nice to have)
- Custom domain
- If backfill succeeds but those activities aren't inserted, we need to be able to catch that error - store activity count alongside updating backfill_status?
- Sort trails by completion percentage
- Explain when user has completed a trail
- Check and respect rate limits to avoid overuse
- Review screens that flash content - consider global loading state?
- Add user settings for units and activity types to include

VERY LOW (maybe do at some point)
- Show background processing completion on /trails/[id]
- Look into pulling streams and processing these in addition to polylines - is it really necessary? What's the max. privacy area on Strava?
- Check we meet Strava brand guidelines
- Consider alternative map tiles / mapping library
- Dark mode
- Add activity browser/search in /account
- Consider checking athlete backfill/processing status on exchange to figure out where to redirect them to (could avoid /backfill flashing up if we check it before redirecting)
