NOW

MEDIUM (needed before launch)
- Break down processing so more activity/route pairs can be marked as processed sooner
- Check we're using sport_type and not the deprecated field 'type'
- If backfill succeeds but those activities aren't inserted, we need to be able to catch that error - store activity count alongside updating backfill_status?
- Add more trails
- Show background processing completion on /trails/[id]
- Setting map zoom level seems to work locally but not when deployed... Weird
- Add favicon and Strava app icon

LOW (nice to have)
- Potentially use a context for strava/auth?
- Sort trails by completion percentage
- Explain when user has not started a trail
- Explain when user has completed a trail
- Check and respect rate limits to avoid overuse
- Consider a mapping library with support for static maps (e.g. for activity summary maps - loading lots of interactive maps but disabling interaction doesn't seem sensible)
- Check user is redirected to / if not authed on all pages (e.g. /pending)
- Review screens that flash content - consider global loading state?
- Add user settings for units and activity types to include
- Returning to /backfill after leaving it during backfill/processing, it sometimes says "0 activities loaded" incorrectly

VERY LOW (maybe do at some point)
- Look into pulling streams and processing these in addition to polylines - is it really necessary? What's the max. privacy area on Strava?
- Check we meet Strava brand guidelines
- Consider alternative map tiles / mapping library
- Dark mode
- Pretty up the headline route stats on /trails
- Add activity browser/search in /account
