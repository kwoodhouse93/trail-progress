TODO: Implement deauth? Not sure it makes sense, but maybe just delete any local copies of the token if 401 Unauthorized is received?
TODO: Check and respect rate limits to avoid overuse
TODO: STYLING âœ¨
TODO: Implement Strava brand guidelines
TODO: Set up OAuth in deployment (including redirects not just to localhost)
TODO: Allow user to log out or change accounts
TODO: Consider a mapping library with support for static maps (e.g. for activity summary maps - loading lots of interactive maps but disabling interaction doesn't seem sensible)
TODO: Look into simplifying tracks, e.g. Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm, implemented in Simplify.js
